# Townlands

There are around 60,000 townlands in Ireland, and almost all (~96%) of them have been documented by townlands.ie. Their data set provides names (in Irish and English), as well as areas and shapefiles for all of the documented townlands. Using these data I did some simple analysis of the townlands, and made some maps.

The number of townlands per sq km varies by almost a factor of 2 from the smallest to largest density, as the choropleth shows, with Monaghan having the largest density.

Interestingly the most common townland name in Ireland is Glebe. As you'd expect the most common starts to names are "Bally" in Engligh and "Baile" in Irish (other than "An"). There's a really big divide between names in the Eastern and Western part of the island, with "*town" being very commong in the Pale, and far less so elsewhere, and names beginning with "Gort" or "Cloon" being confined to the West
